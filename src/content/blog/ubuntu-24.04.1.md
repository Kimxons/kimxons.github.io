Users of Ubuntu 22.04 LTS will soon be prompted to upgrade to 24.04 LTS, either automatically or as part of a scheduled update. This upgrade path provides a seamless transition to the latest Ubuntu release, allowing users to take advantage of the newest features and improvements. If you missed our initial press release, don't worryâ€”we've summarized the key developments in this post to help you get ready to upgrade.

## User Experience and Performance Enhancements

Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS introduces several user experience and performance enhancements, driven by the GNOME 46 desktop environment. These include:

- Improved File Manager: Enhanced search capabilities and performance improvements make file management more efficient.
- Expandable Notifications: Notifications are now more informative and interactive, allowing users to expand and interact with them directly.

  Additionally, the installer now supports ZFS encryption and autoinstall configurations, providing more robust provisioning options. The new App Center and a dedicated firmware update application further enrich the user experience, delivering better performance and usability.

## Ideal for Data Science and Development

Ubuntu 24.04 LTS continues to be the preferred platform for open-source software vendors and community projects. It ships with the latest toolchains for popular programming languages like Python, Rust, Ruby, Go, PHP, and Perl. Users also get early access to updates for key libraries and packages, ensuring they can work with the latest tools.

In data science and machine learning, Ubuntu remains the OS of choice for leading frameworks such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and Kubeflow. The Canonical Data Science Stack, included with this release, allows for the quick setup of machine learning environments right out of the box, making it easier for developers and data scientists to focus on innovation.

## Conclusion

Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS is now available for download in both Desktop and Server flavors, along with the official Ubuntu flavors like Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Lubuntu, and more.
